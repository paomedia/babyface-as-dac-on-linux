Set RME Babyface-pro to convert spdif signal to analog/XLR/Main output

Just a Python snipet to set up your RME device into a Digital to Analog converter.
As I use Windows(tm) to make music and Linux to code on a dual-boot computer,
I took a toslink/spdif cable to bring sound on my speakers during coding times.

This bit of code set it correctly for me...
This script needs usb-1 python lib and be run as root.
You can sudo it at startup without password with permission on 'visudo'

This is just a share which can be helpfull for few people with some linux skills


Excuse my french ;)
